						<h2>Sri Lanka Ancient Cities</h2>
                        <br>
						<p>
                           Sri Lanka was not only a rich and beautiful island but it was also the seat of one of the small but important historical civilizations of Asia, taking its place amongst the most advanced and developed nations of the pre-modern world...



<br>

 

Documents history of Sri Lanka dates back to 3rd c. B.C.The gentle way of Buddhism introduce in 247 c. B.C. wich, transformed theIndo-Aryan Sinhalese has produced magnificent feats of architecture and construction. In the masive dagobas, the ornate pleasure gardensand palaces and the exquisite sculpture which abounds, particularly at Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. Sri Lanka's ancient cities are also the centres of the irrigation works of the past. Massive reservoirs built to collect rain water, river diversions, giant aqueducts and miles long irrigation channels are proof of a civilization highly developed in the science of irrigation, hydraulics and water management. Most of these ancient irrigation works such as the Tissa Wewa, Basawakkulama and Nuwara Wewa at Anuradhapura; the massive Parakrama Samudhra or Sea of Parakrama, Giritale and Minneriya in the Polonnaruwa region, the Kalawewa and Balaluwewa still provide water to irrigate the rice fields of the dry zone in Sri Lanka.


                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Ancient City Anuradhapura: <br>

Sri Lanka's first capital, founded in the 5 c.B.C. according to the ancient / Sinhala chronicle Mahavamsa, was a model of planning with precincts set aside for huntsmen, scavengers, heretics as well as for foreigners. There were separate cemetaries for high and low castes, hostels and hospitals. Anuradhapura was an example par excellence of a Hydraulic Civilization. The construction of reservoirs, canals and irrigation channels during this period exhibited and amazing knowledge of trigonometry and the design of reservoirs a thorough grasp of hydraulic principles. The ornamental scale of the large reservoirs is compelling evidence of a thriving economy and a state structure which had resources from a agricultural surplus and profits from trade to invest in these projects as well as on religious and public buildings designed on a lavish scale. The unique feature of Buddhist Sri Lanka is the Stupa(Dagoba), which enshrined relics of the Buddha and where objects of veneration. It is generally a solid, hemispherical dome, which expresses the serenity and simplicity the quintessence of Buddhism. The 'Rajarata' - the King's country is dotted with these stupas and the picturesque lakes which has an irrisistible charm for the visitor. There are many important stupas at Anurahapura.

 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Ancient City Mihintale: <br>
                            The 'Cradle of Buddhism', 11km east of Anuradhapura. Its history dates back to 247c.B.C when King Devanampiyatissa met Arhath mahinda the great Buddhist missionary who preached the Buddhist doctrine to the King. Mihintale, the mountain of Mahinda was identified as a great monastic city. The rock is dotted with shrines and rock dwellings. Today it is venerated daily, especially on Poson full moon poya day commemorating this historic event. A majestic flight of 1840 granite steps, 5 metres wide lead you to the summit with its splendid views of the surrounding country side. An atmophere of serenity and peace. The King having embraced Buddhism declared the forest where he met the Sage, a sanctuary, the first historically documented sactuary in the world.




                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Ancient City Polonnaruwa: <br>
                            The Island's medieval capital (11c. & 12c.) rose to fame after the decline of Anuradhapura. The city in its day was fortified with three concentric walls, beautified with parks and gardens and sactified by many shrines. Polonnaruwa shows the interesting blend of the influence of the South Indian Hindu culture on the Sinhala Buddhist art and architecture in the scattered shrines and monuments still venerated daily by devotees. The Siva Devales are interesting transposition of the Hindu style of decor. Other interesting ruins are, the King'd Counsil Chamber the floral stone pillars of Nissanka Lata Mandapaya, the Royal Citadel, Kumara Pokuna (baths), the thuparama with its original vaulted roof, the exquiste circular Vatadage relic house, lavished with moonstones, guardstones and sculptured railings, Kiri Vehera, the best preserved of Sri Lanka's un-restored dagobas.


                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Ancient City Sigiriya : <br>
                            This rock fortress was built by King Kasyapa in the 5th century A.D. and was a royal citadel for more than 18 years. It is a complex of buildings, part royal palace, part fortified town, and water gardens on par with the best in the ancient world, constitute a magnificent and unique architectural feat of the ancient Sinhalese. In a sheltered pocket approached by a spiral stairway are the famous Sigiriya frescoes, the earliest surviving pictorial art of Sri Lanka and of the same period as the Ajantha frescoes of India. The summit of the rock with an area of nearly one hc was the site of the palace. It is regarded as the 8th wonder of the ancient world.


                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Ancient City Dambulla: <br>
Like Sigiriya, dambulla is a vast isolated rock mass and it was here King Valagam Bahu took refuge in the 1c.B.C. He later turned the caves into a rock temple. Sits rock ceiling is one large sweep of colourful paintings which depict Buddhist mythology and tales of the Buddha's previous births. Some of them are over 2000 years old. Within the cave temple is the collection of the largest number of Buddha statues in one place. There is also a recumbent Buddha carved out of the living rock, some 14m long. 
19km sounth of Dambull, it is the earliest all stone building 8c. found in Sri Lanka. Believed to be a Mahayanist shrine owing to rare tantric carvings of sensuous nature. However it is an amalgamation of Hindu and Buddhist architecture.

                        <p>
                        Ancient City Kurunegala: <br>
                            An interesting transit stop on the route to Sri Lanka's Ancient Cities and the East Coast. Surrounded by looming rocky outcrops including the huge Ethagala (Elephant Rock) and the Kurunagale lake adding scenic beauty, it is a historic town of much character. It came in to promnence during the 13th and 14th centuries when it was the capital of Sinhala Kings. The town itself does not boast of many ruins but de-tours or excursions could be made to Yapahuwa midway between Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, served as the capital of King Bhuvenekabahu1 (1272 - 1284). The Mayan like steep stairway of the ruins of the Temple of the Tooth is the most striking feature of this site. The Padeniya Buddhist Temple (25 km) is a charming medieval temple of unique character. Arankale a 6th c. forest hermitage (24 km) and Panduwasnuwara capitalof Parakramabahu 1 (12th c.) as a regional rular, who later became the rular of Polonnaruwa. The remains of the big palace complex is the main attraction. Ridigama a caveTemple nearly 2000 years oldis 18 km from Kurunegala. An intricate ivory paneled door frame, a gilt sedent Buddha and a large reclining Buddha are its main features.
